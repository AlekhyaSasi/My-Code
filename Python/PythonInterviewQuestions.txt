What are the ways to write a function using call by reference?
Arguments in python are passed as an assignment. This assignment creates an object that has no relationship between an argument name in source and target.
The procedure to write the function using call by reference includes:
The tuple result can be returned to the object which called it. The example below shows it:
def function(a, b):
a = 'value'
b = b + 1
# a and b are local variables that are used to assign the new objects
return a, b
# This is the function that is used to return the value stored in b
- The use of global variables allows the function to be called as reference but this is not the safe method to call any function.
- The use of mutable (they are the classes that consists of changeable objects) objects are used to pass the function by reference.
def function(a):
a[0] = 'string'
a[1] = a[1] + 1
# The ‘a’ array give reference to the mutable list and it changes the changes that are shared
args = ['string', 10]
func1(args)
print args[0], args[1]
#This prints the value stored in the array of ‘a’
